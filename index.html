  What’s different about Manage?

  Manage provides all the functionality your team needs, without 
  the complexity. Our software is tailor-made for modern digital 
  product teams. 

  01
  Track company-wide progress
  See how your day-to-day tasks fit into the wider vision. Go from 
  tracking progress at the milestone level all the way done to the 
  smallest of details. Never lose sight of the bigger picture again.

  02
  Advanced built-in reports
  Set internal delivery estimates and track progress toward company 
  goals. Our customisable dashboard helps you build out the reports 
  you need to keep key stakeholders informed.

  03
  Everything you need in one place
  Stop jumping from one service to another to communicate, store files, 
  track tasks and share documents. Manage offers an all-in-one team 
  productivity solution.
